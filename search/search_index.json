A solution is to iterate like this: const UEnum* const Enum = StaticEnum<EEnumType>(); const int32 NumEnumValues = ComparisonTypeEnum->NumEnums() - (ComparisonTypeEnum->ContainsExistingMax() ? 1 : 0); for (int32 Index = 0; Index < NumEnumValues; ++Index) { const EEnumTypeValue = static_cast<EEnumType>(Enum->GetValueByIndex(Index)); ... I'm not 100% sure this covers all possible extra meta enum values, but this solution has worked for me until now. Triggers Trigger overlap events at actor load By default OnComponentBeginOverlap and similar events will not trigger during actor loading. You can see this by adding a breakpoint in UPrimitiveComponent::UpdateOverlapsImpl and you'll see the initial call coming from DispatchBeginPlay has bDoNotifies set to false. Now this is unless you set the bGenerateOverlapEventsDuringLevelStreaming flag ( Generate Overlap Events During Level Streaming in editor details) for the actor containing your component. Note that the flag suggests this has something to do with streaming, but actually this should say \"level loading\". Overlap updates Unreal optimizes how and when overlaps are calculated. This is mainly implemented in UPrimitiveComponent::UpdateOverlapsImpl . The function is called once when the containing actor begins play and then only when something possibly changes - e.g. when something moves. When a primitive component moves it calls update overlaps for itself only. It generates a new set of overlaps, and calls BeginOverlapComponent / EndOverlapComponent for components that are now overlapping and haven't before and vice-versa. This also updates the OverlappingComponents array for the moved primitive component as well as the components for which the overlap events are generated. A side effect of this is that if you add any \"logical\" overlaps, that is overlaps not based on physical bodies, these overalps may be cleaned up by another component. This was a problem for ZkzCompositeVolumeComponent where I tried to generate overlaps in UpdateOverlapsImpl , but whenever an overlapping player moved it would remove them (as it was unable to reproduce them based on physical bodies). The only way I found to work around this issue is to not derive from PrimitiveComponent for composite volumes. Unfortunately this also means overlap events are only generated for the composite volume, not for the player.
